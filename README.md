# Anemia Risk Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

This project utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict anemia risk in patients based on their blood test results. The model is trained using clinical data provided in an Excel file and predicts whether new patients are at risk of developing anemia.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
